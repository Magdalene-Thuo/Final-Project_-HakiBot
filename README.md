# Final-Project_-HakiBot
HakiBot is a lightweight AI chatbot that provides instant, reliable answers to common legal questions based on Kenyan labour laws and constitutional rights. Built using Python, FAISS, and sentence-transformers, it helps users understand their rights around employment, arrest, and police conduct â€” for free, and in plain language.
